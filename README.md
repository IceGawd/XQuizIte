**Flashcard-powered XR learning for XREAL glasses, conceptualized at Immerse The Bay 2025**

## Getting Started  
To start working, first set up the repository locally.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IceGawd/XQuizIte.git
cd xquizite
```
This should clone all the Unity files and directories needed to get set up for development. Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/IceGawd/XQuizIte/wiki) for further information on building in Unity.


## Description
XQuizIte is an XR quiz app designed for the XREAL Air 2 Ultra on the XREAL 3.0 SDK that was conceptualized and built within 36 hours at the Stanford Immerse the Bay XR hackathon. It overlays flash-card style notecards in your field of view, allowing users to interact with the notecards via a touch-to-reveal and swipe-to-next interface workflow for the end user. Questions are generated via AI APIs (OpenAI for our hackathon's choice of tool).

## Toolset
- Unity 6.0 LTS
- XREAL SDK 3.0
- OpenAI API
